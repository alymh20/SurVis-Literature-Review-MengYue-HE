abstract = {The teaching and learning methodology in a typical engineering education system involves a teacher teaching to a group of 30 to 60 students and hence the students have a common learning path. With the advent of technology like Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, past historic data in an institution and current data of student profiles and performance can be used to analyse and predict learning gaps and suggest the learning steps a student has to take to improve his/her performance. This will result in each student having a personalized learning path. As many institutions have a well-defined Quality Management System (QMS) in line with the ISO 9001: 2015 standards and past data, they can adopt this new technology and hence achieve disruption in the education system in a phased manner.},

abstract = {Sustainable education is a crucial aspect of creating a sustainable future, yet it faces several key challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and a lack of awareness and engagement. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to address these challenges and enhance sustainable education by improving access to quality education, creating personalized learning experiences, and supporting data-driven decision-making. One outcome of using AI and Information Technology (IT) systems in sustainable education is the ability to provide students with personalized learning experiences that cater to their unique learning styles and preferences. Additionally, AI systems can provide teachers with data-driven insights into student performance, emotions, and engagement levels, enabling them to tailor their teaching methods and approaches or provide assistance or intervention accordingly. However, the use of AI and IT systems in sustainable education also presents challenges, including issues related to privacy and data security, as well as potential biases in algorithms and machine learning models. Moreover, the deployment of these systems requires significant investments in technology and infrastructure, which can be a challenge for educators. In this review paper, we will provide different perspectives from educators and information technology solution architects to connect education and AI technology. The discussion areas include sustainable education concepts and challenges, technology coverage and outcomes, as well as future research directions. By addressing these challenges and pursuing further research, we can unlock the full potential of these technologies and support a more equitable and sustainable education system.},

abstract = {An Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) has been shown to improve students' learning outcomes by providing a personalized curriculum that addresses individual needs of every student. However, despite the effectiveness and efficiency that ITS brings to students' learning process, most of the studies in ITS research have conducted less effort to design the interface of ITS that promotes students' interest in learning, motivation and engagement by making better use of AI features. In this paper, we explore AI-driven design for the interface of ITS describing diagnostic feedback for students' problem-solving process and investigate its impacts on their engagement. We propose several interface designs powered by different AI components and empirically evaluate their impacts on student engagement through Santa, an active mobile ITS. Controlled A/B tests conducted on more than 20K students in the wild show that AI-driven interface design improves the factors of engagement by up to 25.13%.},

abstract = {Recent technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have paved the way for improved and in many cases the creation of entirely new and innovative, electronic writing tools. These writing support systems assist during and after the writing process making them indispensable to many writers in general and to students in particular who can get human-like sentence completion suggestions and text generation. Although the wide adoption of these tools by students has been faced with a steady growth of scientific publications in the field, the results of these studies are often contradictory and their validity may be questioned. To gain a deeper understanding of the validity of AI-powered writing assistance tools, we conducted a systematic review of the recent empirical AI-powered writing assistance studies. The purpose of this review is twofold. First, we wanted to explore the recent scholarly publications that evaluated the use of AI-powered writing assistance tools in the classroom in terms of their types, uses, limits, and potential for improving students’ writing skills. Second, the review also sought to explore the perceptions of educators and researchers about learners’ use of AI-powered writing tools and review their recommendations on how to best ingrate these tools into the contemporary and future classroom. Using the Scopus research database, a total of 104 peer-reviewed papers were identified and analyzed. The findings indicate that students are increasingly using a variety of AI-powered writing assistance tools for improving their writing. The tools they are using can be categorized into four main groups: (1) automated writing evaluation tools, (2) tools that provide automated writing corrective feedback, (3) AI-powered machine translators, and (4) GPT-3 automatic text generators. The analysis also highlighted the scholars’ recommendations regarding dealing with learners’ use of AI-powered writing assistance tools and grouped the recommendations into two groups for researchers and educators.},

abstract = {Assessment in the Education system plays a significant role in judging student performance. The present evaluation system is through human assessment. As the number of teachers' student ratio is gradually increasing, the manual evaluation process becomes complicated. The drawback of manual evaluation is that it is time-consuming, lacks reliability, and many more. This connection online examination system evolved as an alternative tool for pen and paper-based methods. Present Computer-based evaluation system works only for multiple-choice questions, but there is no proper evaluation system for grading essays and short answers. Many researchers are working on automated essay grading and short answer scoring for the last few decades, but assessing an essay by considering all parameters like the relevance of the content to the prompt, development of ideas, Cohesion, and Coherence is a big challenge till now. Few researchers focused on Content-based evaluation, while many of them addressed style-based assessment. This paper provides a systematic literature review on automated essay scoring systems. We studied the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques used to evaluate automatic essay scoring and analyzed the limitations of the current studies and research trends. We observed that the essay evaluation is not done based on the relevance of the content and coherence.},

abstract = {Grading assignments is inherently subjective and time-consuming; automatic scoring tools can greatly reduce teacher workload and shorten the time needed for providing feedback to learners. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel method for automatically scoring student responses to picture-cued writing tasks. As a popular paradigm for language instruction and assessment, a picture-cued writing task typically requires students to describe a picture or pictures. Correspondingly, the automatic scoring methods must measure the link(s) between visual pictures and their textual descriptions. For this purpose, we first designed a picture-cued writing test and collected nearly 4 k responses from 279 K12 students. Based on these responses, we then developed an AI scoring model by incorporating the emerging cross-modal matching technology and some NLP algorithms. The performance of the model was evaluated carefully with six popular measures and was found to demonstrate accurate scoring results with a small mean absolute error of 0.479 and a high adjacent-agreement rate of 90.64%. We believe this method could reduce the subjective elements inherent in human grading and save teachers’ time from the mundane task of grading to other valuable endeavors such as designing teaching plans based on AI-generated diagnosis of student progress.},

abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused significant disruption in all sectors and industries around the world. To tackle the spread of the novel coronavirus, the learning process and the modes of delivery had to be altered. Most courses are delivered traditionally with face-to-face or a blended approach through online learning platforms. In addition, researchers and educational specialists around the globe always had a keen interest in predicting a student’s performance based on the student’s information such as previous exam results obtained and experiences. With the upsurge in using online learning platforms, predicting the student’s performance by including their interactions such as discussion forums could be integrated to create a predictive model. The aims of the research are to provide a predictive model to forecast students’ performance (grade/engagement) and to analyse the effect of online learning platform’s features. The model created in this study made use of machine learning techniques to predict the final grade and engagement level of a learner. The quantitative approach for student’s data analysis and processing proved that the Random Forest classifier outperformed the others. An accuracy of 85% and 83% were recorded for grade and engagement prediction respectively with attributes related to student profile and interaction on a learning platform.},

abstract = {The utilization of learning analytics to identify at-risk students for early intervention has exhibited promising results. However, most predictive models utilized to address this issue have been based on non-probabilistic machine learning models. In response, this study incorporated probabilistic machine learning for two reasons: (1) to facilitate the inclusion of domain knowledge, and (2) to enable the quantification of uncertainty in model parameters and predictions. The study developed a five-stage, probabilistic logistic regression model to identify at-risk students at different stages throughout the academic calendar. Rather than predicting a student’s final or exam mark, the model was focused on predicting the at-risk probabilities for subsequent assessments—specifically, the probability of a student failing an upcoming assessment. The model incorporated student engagement data from Moodle, as well as demographic and student performance data. The study’s findings indicate that the significance and certainty of student engagement and demographic variables decreased after incorporating student-performance variables, such as assignments and tests. The most effective week for identifying at-risk students was found to be week 6, when the accuracy was 92.81%. Furthermore, the average level of uncertainty exhibited by the models decreased by 60% from stage 3 to 5, indicating more reliable predictions at later than earlier stages. The study highlights the potential of a probabilistic machine learning model to aid instructors and practitioners in identifying at-risk students, and thereby to enhance academic outcomes.},
